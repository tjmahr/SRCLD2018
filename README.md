Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Development of familiar word recognition in preschoolers**
> 
> Recent work suggests word recognition efficiency—how well children map
> incoming speech to words—may help identify early differences in
> children’s language trajectories. We administered a word recognition
> experiment during each year of a 3-year longitudinal study with 160
> preschoolers. Ages were 2.5–3 years in year 1 and 4.5–5 years in
> year 3. In the experiment, four images of familiar nouns were
> presented onscreen followed by a prompt to view one of the images
> (e.g., *find the bell!*). Images included the target word (e.g.,
> *bell*), a semantically related word (*drum*), a phonologically
> similar word (*bee*), and an unrelated word (*swing*). Early
> differences in word recognition were longitudinally stable so that
> children who were faster and more accurate at age 3 were relatively
> fast and accurate at age 5. Moreover, word recognition efficiency at
> age 3 was a much stronger predictor of age-5 vocabulary size than
> concurrent (age-5) word recognition efficiency. These results confirm
> that word recognition behavior provides an important early predictor
> of vocabulary growth. *Research supported by R01 DC002932, R01
